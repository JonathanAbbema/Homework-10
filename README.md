# 10 Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker

### User Story

```md
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer

## Description 

This is an OOP index file that utilizes the terminal to promp the user to provide inputs for a logo design. 
The prompts asks for what shape, the color of the shape, the color of the text, and three characters of text. 
When the user correctly responds to the prompts the terminal will indicate that "Your logo.svg has been generated" 
If the user responds incorrectly to the prompts the logo.svg will not be created.
